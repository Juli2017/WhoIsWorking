## H1B Visa Program Faces Charges of Discrimination Against US IT Workers

### 1 March 2017.  <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/379118-laid-off-ucsf-workers-sue/">Laid-off IT workers plan to sue UC San Francisco as jobs outsourced to India </a>

At least 13 employees plan to sue the university for outsourcing their jobs to a group of young men from India, claiming their eliminated jobs amounted to discrimination. Filing a lawsuit will mean no severance pay.

While outsourcing employee abroad isnâ€™t illegal by itself, hiring a group of uniformly young male workers from India runs contrary to a law forbidding bias based on national origin, gender, age, and race.

In an explosive lawsuit that threatens lucrative federal contracts, the U.S. Department of Labor has accused Bay Area tech giant Oracle of paying white men more than other workers and favoring Indians for technical jobs.

# The number of foreign workers has increased dramatically in the past ten years in the Bay Area
As the impact of the housing/job imbalance continues to affect all residents of San Mateo County, is it fair to ask who is getting the new jobs and who is being left behind?
